# Web-Proxy
There are four JAVA files, Proxy.java, ProxyCache.java, HttpRequest.java, and HttpResponse.java.
<br>
Proxy.java is my basic assignment without Caching function extension. While ProxyCache.java is my implementation with Caching
function extension. They can be compiled with "javac -deprecation Proxy.java" (or "javac -deprecation ProxyCache.java") in command line.
<br>
Run the code with "java Proxy 80" (or "java ProxyCache 80"). I used port number 80 when I run my code, and it worked fine.
